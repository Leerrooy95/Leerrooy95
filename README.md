## Hey there, welcome to the profile! 👋

**My profile shows on a journey learning data-science**

---

From [UVB-76](https://github.com/Leerrooy95/UVB-76-Structured-Signal-Analysis)
**Where I gathered data by hand**

To my middle repos where I was dumb and fell for Groks shenanigans.
**The repos are corrected, fabricated data scrubbed, and theyre flagged as unreliable for now**


To [The_Regulated_Friction_Project](https://github.com/Leerrooy95/The_Regulated_Friction_Project)
**Where I finally scraped data with python script, inspected it, and got solid correlations**


**I've developed skills, had a good time, and look foeard to learning more!**

I have my Discord and email in the profile description

### 📈 The Journey

Started with [UVB-76](https://github.com/Leerrooy95/UVB-76-Structured-Signal-Analysis) — gathering data by hand, learning pattern recognition.

Middle repos taught me the hard way about AI hallucinations. Those repos are now corrected and serve as lessons in data verification.

[The Regulated Friction Project](https://github.com/Leerrooy95/The_Regulated_Friction_Project) is where methodology caught up with ambition — automated scraping, statistical validation, reproducible findings.

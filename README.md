## Hey there, welcome to the profile! 👋

**My profile documents my journey learning data science**

---

*From [UVB-76](https://github.com/Leerrooy95/UVB-76-Structured-Signal-Analysis)*
**Where I gathered data by hand**

*To my middle repos where I learned the hard way about AI hallucinations.*
**These repos are now corrected, scrubbed, and serve as a lesson in data verification.**


*Finally, [The_Regulated_Friction_Project](https://github.com/Leerrooy95/The_Regulated_Friction_Project)*
**Where I finally scraped data with python script, inspected it, and got solid correlations**


**I've developed skills, had a good time, and look forward to learning more!**

*I have my Discord and email in the profile description*
